# DiPlay 0.2.11 — release checkpoint pending, 2026-10-03

- Release source starts from merged main `a83ded7`, including PR #175 and the reconciled safety/vehicle-data changes merged through PR #173. Version `0.2.11`, version code `30`, package `com.shihab.diplay`, minimum SDK `28`; Wi-Fi Direct still requires Android 10+.
- Final post-version-bump unit-test totals, lint/debug build results and release lint/build results are pending. Earlier recorded integration and PR #175 checks are historical evidence for those revisions, not the final release result.
- Signing-certificate continuity with 0.2.10, intended runtime identity provisioning, APK credential/entry audits, corresponding source-archive scan and release checksums are pending artifact verification. Android signing keys and accessory identities must remain outside Git and the source archive; source-only CI does not provision them.
- No fresh 0.2.11 vehicle validation is claimed. Qin Plus startup, Wi-Fi Direct loss/stutter, Siri/microphone quality, iOS 15 connection and day/night firmware reports remain open for current-device evidence. Manual channel choice is not a confirmed stutter fix. Optional legacy data/hotspot, parked-video readiness, TV/knob inputs, turn-card placement, wired app-only VPN and geometry reconnect need device acceptance.
- See [0.2.11 release notes](RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.11.md) for exact feature scope and how to export fresh reports. Replace this pending checkpoint with measured final results before publication.

# DiPlay 0.2.10 — 2026-10-03

- Final combined source workflow: 528 unit tests passed (384 shared, 140 common, 4 Home), zero failures/errors. One additional wildcard-bind test skips explicitly on macOS when its socket reuse semantics prevent the intended conflict; the ordinary port-conflict and socket-cleanup tests pass.
- Mobile, Home and map-host debug lint and all three source-only debug APK builds passed. Release lint and the production-signed mobile release build passed. Lint warnings remain (18 mobile debug, 5 Home, 2 map-host; 4 mobile release).
- All ten corrected PR heads passed GitHub Android checks before merging. Tests cover remote-video URL/redirect rejection, bounded artwork queues and stale sessions, USB padding/fragment/coalescing controls, available-port fallback and socket ownership, call effect/mode lifecycle, and bounded privacy-safe diagnostic persistence under blocked writes and callback failures.
- Package `com.shihab.diplay`, version `0.2.10`, version code `29`, minimum SDK `28`. Signing certificate matches the published 0.2.9 APK, preserving the upgrade path.
- Public-source credential checks pass. Release runtime authentication assets match the explicitly selected inputs; no Android signing keystore is packaged. The corresponding source archive and checksums are supplied with the release.
- No fresh on-car validation of 0.2.10 was performed. The captured issue #100 framing pattern is fixed in synthetic and real-reader replay tests; complete media and reconnect operation still needs device confirmation. Huawei/RK3326 Bluetooth, P2P loss and microphone-routing reports remain under investigation. See [release notes](RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.10.md).

# DiPlay 0.2.9 — 2026-10-02

- 420 unit tests passed: 109 common, 307 shared, and 4 Home sample tests, with zero failures, errors or skipped tests.
- Mobile release lint and the production-signed release build passed; lint warnings remain.
- Package `com.shihab.diplay`, version `0.2.9`, version code `28`. Signing certificate matches the published 0.2.8 APK.
- Ten floating-map gesture tests include stable initial contact, both size limits, pointer changes, persistence, and enlarging a reopened minimum-sized card.
- Public-tree and source-archive scans exclude runtime identities, signing keys, and build output. Runtime authentication assets in the APK match the explicitly selected local inputs; the Android signing key is excluded.
- The test variant was installed on DiLink 5.1 and user feedback drove the floating-map fixes. The production APK has not had a separate on-car test. Broader vehicle checks remain documented in [release notes](RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.9.md).

# Restored 0.1.0 release — 2026-09-25

- Built from the current public source with explicitly selected external authentication assets and the existing local Android signing key.
- 172 JVM/Robolectric tests passed; zero failures/errors. Release lint and signed release build passed.
- Public-tree credential scan passed. Source tests generate identities at runtime; no credential containers or private-key blocks are tracked.
- Verified that the APK contains the intended runtime accessory identity and no Android signing keystore.
- Signing certificate SHA-256: `87b38b12788dcb202a961215f2572e30ec2dc9d8ef4bc070d05f77e49291a363` (unchanged).
- Package `com.shihab.diplay`, version `0.1.0`, version code `10`; restoration changes packaging and public documentation, not app behavior.
- Existing USB-only TLS trust-manager warnings and unused-resource warning remain; this is not a completed security audit.
- No fresh physical-car validation was performed for the restored artifact. Previous emulator and private-build testing do not establish universal compatibility.
